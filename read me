*we build this compression service with python3 and tkinter
*we   tested this on linux based platforms
*to install the above required packages
		$sudo apt install python3

		$sudo apt install python3-pip

		$pip install tkinter
			(or)
		$sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk


there are two folders server and client

*server folder 
	*This folder contains testserver.py and huffman.py
	*Huffman.py is compression algo

	****path changes****
	In testserver.py line 41,77 you need to change the path in the " " given below(/home/jasho007/Desktop/SUBMISSION/client part you need to change).

	path = "/home/jasho007/Desktop/SUBMISSION/client/"+fname10+'_recieved.txt'

	

*client folder
	*This folder contains testclient.py testdclient.py testcheckserver.py testexit.py guitest1.py

	  ****path changes****
	  testgui1.py line 135,161 you need to change the path in the initialdir given below 

	  filename = filedialog.askopenfilename(initialdir="/home/jasho007/Desktop/SUBMISSION/client/", title="Select A File", filetypes=(("txt files", "*.txt"),("all files", "*.*")))

**after checking files and changing paths in respective folders** 
	*Inorder to run the server you need to open the terminal in that folder(server) and use this command $python3 testserver.py
	*Inorder to run the client you need to open the terminal in that folder(client) and use this command $python3 testgui1.py

	*if in local machine IP address is 127.0.0.1 else you need to know the IP address of the server.

#if client sends sample.txt after compression client will get two files sample.bin and sample.json

#if client sends sample.bin sample.json is selected automatically after decompression client will get sample_decompressed.txt
